# taproot-assets

High-level Rust SDK for interacting with Taproot Assets.

This crate bundles shared types, gRPC client bindings, and utility logic for
building Rust applications that interface with the
[Taproot Assets daemon](https://github.com/lightninglabs/taproot-assets). It
does not implement the protocol itself.

## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
taproot-assets = { version = "0.0.1" }
```
