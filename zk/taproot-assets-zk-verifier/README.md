# taproot-assets-zk-verifier

Zero-knowledge proof verifier for Taproot Assets.

This crate provides verification logic for ZK proofs generated by Taproot Assets
guest circuits. It is designed for use with proof systems like
[RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com/) and integrates with the shared interfaces
in `taproot-assets-zk-core`.

## Guests

The verifier expects prebuilt guest ELFs. `ClaimElfs::load_default` loads
them from `target/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker`. Build guests with
`make build-zk` (or `make build-all` if you want the rest of the workspace).

## Parity Testing

- Run `RUN_ZK_PARITY=1 cargo test -p taproot-assets-zk-verifier --test zk_parity`.
- The test compares join outputs with core verification for upstream vectors.
- Vectors are read from `external/taproot-assets-upstream/proof/testdata` and the
  test skips if they are missing.

## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
taproot-assets-zk-verifier = { version = "0.0.1" }
```
